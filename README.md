# UAS-Task
Code for UAS
The only thing this code lacks is a method to decide which contour consists the alphabet part, then i can easily blacken out the rest of the image
i have tried a few methods to do so, like contour size but none off them are giving me the desired result for every sample image.
Even after the submission, i will keep updating the code for improvements
